                    <p> This month didn’t feel like a movie. No fancy setup. No candlelight dinner. Just us, walking
                        into
                        Angel’s Pizza, craving the "Sana All Jowa Package" and hoping the cheese could fix our moods. 😅

                <p>This month didn’t feel like a movie. No fancy setup. No candlelight dinner. Just us, walking into
                    Angel’s Pizza, craving the "Sana All Jowa Package" and hoping the cheese could fix our moods. 😅

                    But even that simple dinner turned into something to remember. We saw the staff arguing by the
                    counter. You leaned in, grinning, “Nag-aaway sila oh,” like we were watching a teleserye live. Then
                    you spotted the manager on his phone and said, “Yung manager chill lang, parang naglalaro pa.” I
                    laughed, your commentary was better than any Netflix show. 😂

                    Turns out, the manager was just on break. But for a moment, we wrote an entire drama in our heads,
                    complete with backstory and character development. It’s funny how even the little things become
                    adventures with you.

                    We ate. We talked. We teased each other. And somewhere between the first slice and the last bite, I
                    felt something bigger than food, comfort. Like even when we argue or misunderstand each other, we
                    still come back to the same table. Together.</p>

                <div class="image main"><img src="../images/image137.jpg" alt="" /></div>

                <p>This month, we had our rough days. Small fights over little things. Misread moods. Unspoken
                    frustrations. We both changed, grew, and maybe even confused each other more than once. But you know
                    what? That’s part of it.

                    Love isn’t just about the “I miss you” or “good morning baby” texts. It’s about sticking around when
                    things get weird, when one of us is tahimik and the other’s overthinking. It’s holding hands even
                    after a misunderstanding. It’s still choosing each other, even if we’re both tired.

                    So please, love, no more “break-up” jokes. Even if we’re annoyed or tampo, let’s not threaten what
                    we’re trying to build. We promised to love like we meant it, to stay even during the ugly days, not
                    just when it’s easy.

                    And okay fine, I admit… the ending to that date was a little chaotic. You watched me rush home
                    because *pizza overload + full stomach = CR panic mode*. But hey, I made it. Alive, loved, and a
                    little bit lighter. 😂</p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="../images/image138.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                <p>Through everything, I still believe in us. In our little world where even simple nights feel magical.
                    Where even the tiniest memory becomes a page in our story. Where love isn’t just spoken, it’s lived.


                    Here’s to more months. To more quiet battles. More sweet recoveries. To plans for the future. And to
                    never forgetting the good, even when the bad tries to take over.

                    I love you, not just when you’re sweet and smiling, but also when you’re moody, silent, or
                    sarcastic.
                    Even when you judge pizza managers too fast. 😆</p>

                <p>Still yours, always,<br />
