					<h1>Too far<br />
						yet too close</h1>
					<p>Even with the distance between us, our hearts never drifted apart. It was our first real trial, a
						test of patience, trust, and love. But instead of breaking us, it brought us closer, reminding
						us how deeply we care for each other. Through every missed hug and late-night call, we proved
						that love isn’t measured by miles, but by the strength of the bond we share.</p>

				<p>Even with the distance between us, our hearts remained close, beating in sync despite the miles that
					tried to separate us. It was our first real trial, a test of everything that makes love real:
					patience, trust, loyalty, and emotional strength. There were moments when the longing hit hard, when
					I wished I could just hold your hand, see your smile in person, or hear your voice without a screen
					in between. But even in those quiet moments of missing you, my heart never doubted us, not for a
					second.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image22.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>That time apart didn’t weaken what we have, it made it stronger. It showed me just how much you mean
					to me, how powerful our connection is, and how much we’re willing to fight for this love. Every
					late-night call, every good morning and good night message, every virtual moment we created—it all
					reminded me that love isn’t about constant presence, it’s about constant effort. And we both gave
					that, without hesitation.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image23.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>We didn’t just survive the distance, we grew through it. We learned to communicate better, to trust
					deeper, and to love harder. We reminded each other every day that no matter how far apart we were
					physically, emotionally we were always side by side. And that is something truly beautiful.</p>
				<p>So if distance was meant to test us, I’m proud to say we passed. Because what we have isn’t
					ordinary, it’s rare, strong, and real. And now, as we move forward, I know there’s nothing we can’t
					overcome, because we’ve already proven that our bond is stronger than the space between us.</p>
