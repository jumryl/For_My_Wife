                    <h1>Our First Wedding Together<br /> ; A Day to Remember</h1>
                    <p>Hello wifey, happy 8th monthsary! 🥰 This month was not your usual “flowers and pizza” type of
                        celebration. Nope. This month, I got the full *dragon edition* of you. 🐉🔥 Hahaha!</p>
                </header>
                <div class="image main"><img src="../images/august30/image138.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
                <p>Imagine this: we’re at your friend’s brother’s wedding, my first time ever attending a full wedding,
                    from
                    the church ceremony all the way to the reception. I was there, all starry-eyed, feeling like I was
                    in a
                    movie… and then there’s you. Beautiful. Stunning. Radiant. And also… very maldita. 😅
                    Because who else would *walk away without me* just because I had no umbrella? Hahaha!
                    There I was, like a telenovela extra, waiting in the rain until 8:00 pm, hoping the main character
                    (you)
                    would turn back dramatically and say, "Hubs, ali na lakaw nata!” But no, the dragon queen didn’t
                    even
                    look
                    back.
                    😂</p>

                <div class="image main"><img src="../images/august30/image139.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

                <p>And yet… I wasn’t angry. Not even a bit. Because even when you’re the full dragon version of
                    yourself, even
                    when your patience is shorter than my hair after a bad barber cut, I still choose you. Always. ❤️
                    I know I can be “sungogan” at times, trying to make you laugh with jokes that aren’t even funny
                    (admit it,
                    sometimes you laugh just out of pity 😆). But that’s me. That’s how much I love seeing you smile,
                    even when
                    you’re tampo. Even when you forgot it was our monthsary because we were both so busy. (Don’t forget
                    next
                    time ha, hahah!)</p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="../images/august30/image140.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

                <p>We’ve had small fights. Misunderstandings. Unspoken frustrations. You, quiet. Me, overthinking. Me,
                    cracking
                    bad jokes to lighten the mood. You, rolling your eyes. But still, we end up right here, together.
                    That’s
                    our thing. That’s love. Not the perfect Instagram kind, but the kind where you walk away sometimes,
                    and I
                    still wait for you. The kind where even if you turn into a dragon, I’ll still hold the umbrella for
                    you next
                    time. 😂☔. And yes, I still laughed at myself that day, waiting, soaking, but smiling, because
                    somehow, even
                    your
                    “dragon” moments are part of what makes us *us.*</p>

                <div class="image main"><img src="../images/august30/image141.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

                <p>Here’s to more months. More little battles. More sweet recoveries. More future plans. And more of me
                    waiting
                    for you, even when you’re walking ahead like a queen.
                    I love you, not just when you’re sweet and smiling, but also when you’re moody, sarcastic, or
                    full-on
                    dragon-mode. Even when you forget our monthsary. Even when my jokes don’t land. Always, always you.
                    🥰</p>

                <p>Still yours, always,<br />
