					<h1>Samgyupsal's<br />
						Date</h1>
					<p>We celebrated our monthsary at a samgyupsal restaurant after struggling to decide where to eat.
						We finally chose
						samgyupsal to satisfy her cravings, and coincidentally ran into some of our co-workers there. We
						sat at a separate table
						to enjoy our time together, and by the end of the meal, we were both extremely full. One of us
						even got a stomach ache
						from eating too much, so we took a taxi home. We ended the night laughing at each other as we
						slowly walked the rest of
						the way home, full and happy.</p>

				<p>It was our monthsary, and as simple as it sounds, the hardest part of the day was deciding where to
					eat. We wandered
					around for a bit, going back and forth with suggestions, laughing at how indecisive we both were.
					But eventually, she
					smiled and said she was craving samgyupsal, and just like that, the decision was made. I couldn’t
					say
					no to that smile,
					and honestly, I was craving it too.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image133.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>We made our way to one of our favorite samgyupsal spots, a familiar place that always felt warm and
					welcoming. As we
					walked in, we unexpectedly saw some of our co-workers dining there. They waved and greeted us
					cheerfully, and for a
					moment, it felt like a mini reunion. But since it was our special day, we kindly chose to sit at a
					separate table,
					wanting to have our own little moment together.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image134.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>As soon as we sat down, the table quickly filled with plates of meat, fresh lettuce, and endless side
					dishes. We took
					turns grilling, feeding each other bites, and savoring the laughter between us. We talked about the
					little things, our
					day, memories from the past month, and dreams we hadn’t shared before. It was simple, but it felt so
					full of love. There
					was a kind of magic in that ordinary moment that made it unforgettable.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image135.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>Without realizing it, we ended up eating more than we planned. We were so caught up in enjoying each
					other’s company
					that time, and portions, just slipped by. By the end, we leaned back, giggling over how full we
					were,
					holding our bellies
					and smiling at the memory we’d just made. One of us wasn’t feeling too well from eating a little too
					much, so we decided
					to take a taxi home to make things easier.</p>
				<p>The ride was quiet and cozy, filled with soft glances and sleepy smiles. But the sweetest part came
					after, we slowly
					walked the rest of the way home, hand in hand, laughing at ourselves in the most loving way. There
					was no blame, no
					regret, just warmth. Just two people who enjoyed a little too much food, and a lot of love.

					It wasn’t a grand celebration, but it was ours. And somehow, it felt perfect.</p>
