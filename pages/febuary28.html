					<h1>My Favorite<br />
						Flower's</h1>
					<p>For our second monthsary, I wanted to give you something as bright and beautiful as the love
						we’ve
						started to grow. I chose a bouquet with sunflowers, symbols of warmth, loyalty, and
						happiness and
						tulips, which speak of deep love and a promise of forever. Just like our journey, this bouquet
						holds meaning beyond words: a reminder that even in a short time, you’ve already become someone
						truly special to me.</p>

				<p>For our second monthsary, I wanted to give you something that reflected what my heart feels,
					something
					bright, meaningful, and full of love. That’s why I chose a bouquet made of sunflowers and tulips.
					The sunflowers remind me so much of you, radiating warmth, positivity, and a kind of loyalty that
					lights up every moment we share. The tulips, on the other hand, speak the words my heart has been
					quietly saying all along: a deep love, sincere and growing, and a promise of forever with you.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image16.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>This bouquet may seem simple, but it holds more meaning than I can express. Every flower represents a
					part of this journey we’ve started, beautiful, delicate, and real. In just one month, you’ve already
					become someone incredibly special to me. You’ve brought happiness into my life in a way I didn’t
					expect but always hoped for. Your presence, your laughter, and the way you make me feel safe and
					loved, it’s something I’ll never take for granted.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image17.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>I know it’s still early in our journey, but if these first 30 days are anything to go by, I know we
					have something truly worth holding on to. Thank you for being part of my life, for accepting this
					small gesture, and for showing me a kind of love that feels pure and genuine. This is only the
					beginning, and I can’t wait to see where our story takes us next—side by side, heart to heart.</p>
