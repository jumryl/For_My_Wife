					<h1>My Favorite<br />
						Flower's</h1>
					<p>A gift, not something expensive, but something far more valuable. She made it with her
						own hands, simple yet uniquely hers. Every detail showed the care, thought, and love she poured
						into it. It wasn’t just a gift, it was a piece of her heart, and receiving it reminded me how
						lucky I am to be loved by someone so genuine and thoughtful.</p>

				<p>She gave me a gift, not something bought from a fancy store, not wrapped in luxury, but something far
					more meaningful. It was simple, handmade, and completely hers. Every detail reflected her
					heart, carefully thought out, gently crafted, and filled with the kind of love that words alone
					can’t
					fully express. It wasn’t just a gift I could hold in my hands; it was a piece of her soul, her
					effort, her time, and her affection, all poured into something so personal and genuine.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image19.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>As I held it, I couldn’t help but smile, not because of what it was, but because of what it meant. In
					a world where people often show love through grand gestures, she reminded me that the most beautiful
					things often come in the simplest forms. That love isn’t measured by price, but by intention,
					sincerity, and the quiet ways we show someone that they matter.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image20.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>Receiving that gift made me feel truly seen, appreciated, and loved. It reminded me how lucky I am to
					have someone who loves with such a pure and thoughtful heart. And in that moment, I knew, I have
					something rare, something real, something I’ll always treasure.</p>
