                <p>My Baby, My Calm, My Wifey</p>
                <p>Happy 7th Monthsary, Wifey!</p>
                <p>We made it through another month, seven months of love, laughter, late, night kulitan, and yes… a few
                    *mini dramas* over things like “where to eat” or “bakit nag bago ka?” 😅</p>
                <p>This month tested us in different ways. We had little arguments, moments of misunderstanding, and
                    changes we both felt. Our real selves started to show more, and I think that’s a good thing. It
                    means
                    we’re becoming more honest, more real, more... *us*.</p>
                <p>But even through the tampuhan, the mood swings (yes, pati ako!), the unspoken expectations, and the
                    times we just stared at the wall instead of talking, we still chose to fix things. We still held on.
                    That’s love, right? Not always perfect, but always worth it.</p>
                <p>So please, my love, let’s promise again: no more “break-up” threats, kahit joke lang. Kasi kahit
                    biro, medyo nakakakaba ‘yun. Remember, we promised “happily ever after,” not “happily hanggang
                    magkalituhan.” 😂</p>
                <p>Let’s not forget the good times either, the laughs, the food trips, the late-night lambingan, and the
                    random moments where we just knew, “Ikaw nga.” Let’s keep working on ourselves, for each other, and
                    for our future. Whether it’s a dream house or just figuring out who does the dishes tonight
                    (spoiler: ako na if may lambing 😁).</p>
                <p>We’re growing, not just in love, but in patience, in trust, and in our ability to bounce back
                    stronger
                    after every storm. And even if life throws more plot twists at us, let’s be the team that survives
                    the whole season, no cancellation, no recast. 💪</p>
                <p>I love you until the end of time. Even when we argue. Even when I’m makulit. Even when you’re quiet
                    and I have to guess kung galit ka ba or gutom lang. 😅</p>
                <p>To forever with you, no edits, no cuts, just us, learning and loving day by day.</p>
                <p>Yours forever,</p>
                <p>Hubs</p>
