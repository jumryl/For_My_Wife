                <p>My Most Gorgeous Wifey,</p>
                <p>Happy Monthsary, and most especially, Happy Birthday, my wife. ðŸ’–
                <p>Today, we celebrate not only another month of us, but the beautiful day God brought you into this
                    world, the day He gave me the greatest gift Iâ€™ll ever receive.</p>
                </p>
                <p>Each month we grow together, I am reminded of how lucky I am to love and be loved by someone as
                    genuine, strong, and beautiful as you. This journey hasnâ€™t always been easy, but every challenge,
                    every laugh, every silent hug and every silly moment made our love more real, more raw, and more
                    unbreakable.</p>
                <p>This month is even more special because itâ€™s your birthday. And if I could give you the world, I
                    would, but for now, I offer you my whole heart. I assure you:
                <p>â€” That I will always put God first in our relationship so we never lose our way.</p>
                <p>â€” That I will love you every single day, in every season, without question.</p>
                <p>â€” That I will protect you, stand beside you, and never let you carry burdens alone.</p>
                <p>â€” That I will be honest, loyal, and transparentâ€”because you deserve nothing less.</p>
                <p>â€” That I will always be your safe place, your reason to smile, and your home.</p>

                You are more than just my wife. You are my answered prayer, my best friend, my heartâ€™s rest. On your
                birthday, I pray for more joy, peace, and overflowing love in your life, because thatâ€™s what you give me
                every day just by being you.</p>

                <p>So hereâ€™s to your life, your light, and to us, still growing, still choosing each other, and still
                    falling deeper every month.</p>
                <p>I love you. Always and forever.</p>
                <p>Happy Monthsary and Happy Birthday, My Wife.</p>
                <p>Forever yours,</p>
                <p>Jumryl</p>
