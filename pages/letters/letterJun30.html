                <p>My Strength, My Always, My Wifey</p>
                <p>Happy 6th Monthsary, Wifey.</p>
                <p>We’ve now reached the halfway mark of the year, six months of us, of choosing each other through good
                    days and tough nights.</p>
                <p>This past month wasn’t smooth. We had kunting tampuhan, moments of feeling misunderstood, times we
                    felt disregarded or distant. They say that the 6th to 7th month is when the real trials come, when
                    the spark is tested, and the love either weakens or grows deeper.</p>
                <p>And I know one thing for sure… ours is growing deeper.</p>
                <P>Yes, there were days when it felt heavy. Yes, we’ve both changed maybe in our moods, in our tone,
                    or even in how we express things. But even when it got hard, I never wanted to let go. And I pray
                    you never think of letting go either.</P>
                <p>We may challenge each other in words or emotion, but deep inside, you and I both know, we don’t
                    really mean it. If things get shaky again, go back to the promises we made last month. No retreat.
                    No surrender. We meant those words, and I hold onto them with all my heart.</p>
                <p>This is our test, not just of love, but of patience, humility, and teamwork. Let’s continue learning
                    how to talk better, how to listen with more grace, and how to soften when things get rough. Let’s
                    accept each other’s flaws, and protect each other’s hearts, even from the world, and sometimes even
                    from ourselves.</p>
                <p>Because no matter what happens, I’m still yours. And you’re still mine.</p>
                <p>Let’s hold on tighter, love deeper, and walk stronger.</p>
                <p>To infinity with you,</p>
                <p>Jumryl</p>
