                <p>My Wifey,</p>

                <p>Happy 9th Monthsary. ❤️</p>

                <p>This month feels different, deeper. We didn’t just celebrate another date,
                    we shared another milestone together. From witnessing a wedding to attending the baptism of your
                    friend’s child,
                    it feels like life is showing us glimpses of the journey ahead. These moments, these events,
                    make me quietly excited about the future we’re slowly building.</p>

                <p>In these nine months, I’ve realized that love isn’t just about smiles and sweet words.
                    It’s also about patience, respect, and staying even when things get tough.
                    We’ve had our small fights, our misunderstandings, our quiet moments of frustration,
                    but each time, we still choose each other. And every time, that choice makes my love for you
                    stronger.</p>

                <p>I may not always say it perfectly, but I want you to know this:
                    I am grateful for you, for your laughter, for your strength, even for your temper.
                    All of you, even the difficult parts, have taught me what real love feels like.
                    You’re not just my partner; you’re the person who makes even ordinary days feel meaningful.</p>

                <p>As we move forward, I want to keep building something real with you.
                    Something steady, something lasting. No matter how busy we get,
                    no matter how life tests us, my heart is set on you. Always.
                    You are my peace, my anchor, my home.</p>

                <p>I love you completely, when you’re happy, when you’re quiet,
                    when you’re moody, and even when life feels a little overwhelming.
                    In every version of us, I still choose you. And I always will.</p>

                <p>Yours forever,<br />
                    <b>Hubs</b>
                </p>
