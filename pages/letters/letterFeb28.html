                <p>To My Wife</p>
                <p>My Wifey,</p>
                <p>I never knew that walking into that company would mean walking straight into your heart. I saw you
                    sitting alone in the hallway, and something in me just knew, I wanted to be the one sitting beside
                    you forever. You were too focused on your game console to notice me back then, but little did you
                    know, I had already lost… lost to you, completely.</p>
                <p>From our random grocery trips, filling the cart with vegetables you insist I should eat, to our love
                    for Greenwich melted cheese, every simple moment with you became something unforgettable. Our first
                    Christmas party together was special, but honestly, every day with you feels like a celebration.
                    Even when you were just eating an egg bread, I saw how content you were, and that’s when I realized,
                    love isn’t about grand things, it’s about the little moments with you.</p>
                <p>I still remember sneaking out at midnight to pack a lechon, just to surprise you. Love, for me, is
                    knowing what makes you happy and doing it without question. I may have won a prize at the Christmas
                    party, but the real victory was standing beside you. That night, I even sang a song, probably
                    off-key, but I didn’t care, as long as it made you smile.</p>
                <p>There was this one time I bought you a hamburger, planning to surprise you, but you fell asleep. And,
                    well… I may have eaten it instead (sorry, love). You picked out my polo once, and honestly, I think
                    you should just choose all my outfits from now on. Then there was that moment by the Christmas tree,
                    when I looked at you and realized, you are my favorite part of every season.</p>
                <p>Meeting your parents for the first time and giving you flowers on Christmas made me nervous, but also
                    made me feel something deeper, I wasn’t just dating you, I was becoming part of your life. When I
                    saw
                    you sitting on the sofa, holding those flowers, I knew… this is where I belong.</p>
                <p>And then, there was that night. Just me in an empty office, calling you through video chat. My heart
                    was racing as I asked you that question, the one that changed my world. And you said yes.</p>
                <p>Our first date at Sto. Niño Church was quiet but meaningful, our hands held tightly, our prayers
                    unspoken but understood. We took a selfie there, capturing a moment I never want to forget. The day
                    I met your friends, I realized I wasn’t just in love with you, I was in love with everything that
                    made you, you.</p>
                <p>Then came Sinulog. The first day was pure excitement, the second was endless laughter, and the last…
                    the last made me wish time could slow down. Holding your hand while watching the fireworks, I knew,
                    I
                    didn’t just love you, I was meant to.</p>
                <p>On our first monthsary, I gave you embroidered flowers, something that wouldn’t fade, just like my
                    love for you. And when I saw that beautiful LED, lit flower, I thought, it reminds me of you. The
                    light in my life.</p>
                <p>Through every moment, every laughter, every quiet glance, every touch, I have only one thing to say.
                </p>
                <p>I love you. And I am endlessly thankful that I found you.</p>
                <p>Forever yours,</p>
                <p>Jumryl</p>
