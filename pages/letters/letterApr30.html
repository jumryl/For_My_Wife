                <p>My Dearest Wifey,</p>
                <p>Happy 4th Monthsary. üíñ</p>
                <p>April will always remind me of one thing, the strength of our love through distance. While we weren‚Äôt
                    side by side in the way we wanted, our hearts never left each other‚Äôs side. It was our first real
                    trial, and looking back, I realize how powerful that chapter was for us.</p>
                <p>There were nights when I missed your voice, days when all I wanted was your hand in mine. But despite
                    those moments of longing, never once did my heart waver. Because even with miles between us, I felt
                    your presence with every good morning, every call, every message filled with care.</p>
                <P>We were tested, but we didn‚Äôt break. We bloomed.</P>
                <p>We learned to trust more, communicate better, and love harder. That kind of growth only happens when
                    two people refuse to let go of each other no matter what life throws their way.</p>
                <p>I‚Äôm proud of us, for holding on, for choosing each other every day, even when it wasn‚Äôt easy. We
                    didn‚Äôt just endure the distance‚Ä¶ we transformed it into proof that our connection goes far beyond
                    physical presence. It‚Äôs in our hearts, our laughter, our quiet prayers, and all the ‚ÄúI miss yous‚Äù
                    that ended with ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm still here.‚Äù</p>
                <p>This month isn‚Äôt just a celebration of time, it‚Äôs a celebration of the strength we‚Äôve built, the
                    faith
                    we‚Äôve nurtured, and the love that continues to grow deeper with each passing day.</p>
                <p>So thank you, for loving me, for trusting me, and for standing by me even when the world made it a
                    little harder. I know now, with absolute certainty, that there‚Äôs nothing we can‚Äôt overcome together.
                </p>
                <p>Here‚Äôs to month four, to distance conquered, and to every beautiful moment still ahead.</p>
                <p>I love you, always.</p>
                <p>Forever yours,</p>
                <p>Jumryl</p>
