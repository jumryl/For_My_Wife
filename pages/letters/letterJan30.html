                <p>My Dearest Jean,</p>
                <p>Happy New year wifey.....And I want to start it by telling you
                    just how much I love you so much that it feels impossible
                    to put into words.... You are my everything, and no matter what happens... Iâ€™ll
                    always be by your side through every
                    struggle and challenge..... Youâ€™re stuck with me, okay? No refunds, no
                    exchanges!..ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°</p>
                <p>....I promise Iâ€™ll never make you cry (unless itâ€™s from laughing
                    too hard at my jokes....ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£), and Iâ€™ll always choose
                    you, every single day...... Even when your mood swings like a
                    rollercoasterðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­..., Iâ€™ll hold on tight and keep loving
                    you...... You can be as grumpy, dramatic, or even as 'bipolar' as you want, and Iâ€™ll
                    still think youâ€™re the most amazing
                    person in the world......</p>
                <p>Iâ€™ll work on becoming the best version of myself for
                    you.ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°..... one who knows how to take your cute but dramatic
                    moods with a smile and always stocks up on your favorite snacks(chichiria) for
                    night..ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. Youâ€™re my inspiration, my
                    partner, my forever, and the one who makes me laugh at the dumbest things......</p>
                <p>Happy New Year, my Wifey! This year is ours......filled with
                    love, laughter, and me being clingly annoying you every day
                    (because thatâ€™s my love language)....ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°</p>
                <p>Forever yours,</p>
