                <p>My Wifey,</p>
                <p>Happy 8th Monthsary! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

                <p>I just want to thank you for being here, for loving me through my jokes, my lapses, and my
                    occasional stubbornness.
                    Even when you‚Äôre in full *dragon-mode*, very maldita, very sensitive, and quick to walk away just
                    because I didn‚Äôt
                    have an umbrella that day üòÖ, I still love you. I wasn‚Äôt mad, not even a bit. Because honestly,
                    even when you act
                    like that, you‚Äôre still my favorite person in the world.</p>

                <p>I know we have our small fights and misunderstandings. Sometimes, your patience runs out faster than
                    my punchlines.
                    Sometimes I try to make you laugh and fail miserably (but hey, effort counts, right? üòÇ). Still,
                    through all that,
                    I always find myself choosing you, over pride, over anger, over anything else.</p>

                <p>We‚Äôve both learned a lot in these past eight months. Love isn‚Äôt just about the sweet moments; it‚Äôs
                    also about
                    waiting, understanding, and staying when it would‚Äôve been easier to walk away. It‚Äôs about holding
                    on, even when
                    things get a little rough. And I promise, no matter what happens, I‚Äôll always be here, patient,
                    loving, and a bit
                    makulit, waiting for you.</p>

                <p>Let‚Äôs keep building what we started, something real,
                    something strong,
                    something that can outlast any tampuhan or dragon moment. Because at the end of every argument,
                    every silence,
                    every misunderstanding‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still you. Always you. ü•∞</p>

                <p>I love you when you‚Äôre sweet, when you‚Äôre quiet, when you‚Äôre moody, and even when you forget our
                    monthsary. Hahaha!
                    You‚Äôll always be my favorite kind of chaos and my peace all at once.</p>

                <p>Yours forever,<br />
                    <b>Hubs</b>
