                <p>My Wifey,</p>
                <p>Its been Five months.</p>
                <p>Five beautiful, challenging, honest, and meaningful months with you.</p>
                <p>This past month hasn’t been the easiest. We’ve been tired, misunderstood each other at times, and
                    tried to juggle the weight of work and love. But through it all, one thing never changed, we never
                    gave up.</p>
                <p>I’ve seen us both grow. We’re learning to accept each other's flaws, letting time teach us how to
                    love better, deeper, and stronger. There were moments we didn’t see eye to eye, but we didn’t walk
                    away. We stayed, talked, listened, we fought not against each other, but for each other.</p>
                <P>You’re not just my girlfriend, you are my home, my partner, my answered prayer. I already promised
                    you this before, and I’ll say it again and again: I’ll be by your side until infinity.</P>
                <p>So if ever the road gets blurry again, and we start losing our way, remember our first day. Remember
                    how I looked at you. How I held your hand like I never wanted to let go. How you made me nervous and
                    happy at the same time. Remind me of that moment, not because I forgot, but because sometimes,
                    hearing it again makes me fall all over again.</p>
                <p>I will never retreat. I will never surrender. Not now, not ever. Because I chose you. I still do. I
                    always will.</p>
                <p>Happy 5th monthsary, mahal ko. I may call you girlfriend today, but in my heart, you’ve always been
                    my wife.</p>
                <p>Forever yours,</p>
                <p>Jumryl</p>
