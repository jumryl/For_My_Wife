					<h1>A Day of<br />
						Heart's</h1>
					<p>We celebrated Valentine’s Day a day late, but it couldn’t have been more perfect. Under the quiet
						night sky, we shared laughter, dreams, and soft whispers beneath the stars. As we held hands and
						looked up, it wasn’t just about the day, it was about us, and the beautiful future we started to
						dream together that night.</p>

				<p>We may have celebrated Valentine’s Day a day late, but in every way, it felt perfect, more than I
					could have imagined. There was something so special about sharing that quiet night with you, away
					from the usual noise and distractions. Just us, under the stars, with nothing but laughter, soft
					conversations, and the warmth of your hand in mine. It wasn’t about the date or the tradition, it
					was
					about us, and how being together in that moment made everything feel complete.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image13.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>As we sat there, looking up at the sky and talking about our dreams, I realized how lucky I am to
					have you by my side. That night wasn’t just romantic, it was meaningful. It reminded me that real
					love doesn’t need grand gestures or perfect timing. It just needs two people who care deeply for
					each other and who see a future worth dreaming about together.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/image14.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>That evening under the stars will forever be one of my favorite memories, not just because of the
					setting, but because of the feeling of peace and love that came with being with you. I’m so grateful
					for you, for us, and for the way we continue building something beautiful together, one moment at a
					time.</p>
