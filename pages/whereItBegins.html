					<p><b>The First Meeting (August 23, 2024)</b></p>
				</header>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/image11.jpg" alt="" /></span>It was just another
					ordinary
					lunch break under the heat of the August sun. The smell of fried chicken and freshly cooked rice
					lingered in the air as office workers gathered at the neighborhood’s favorite chicken carenderia.
					That’s when it happened, I saw her for the first time.</p>
				<p>We didn’t know each other back then, but something about her presence pulled my attention. Maybe it
					was her lively laugh or the way her voice carried warmth even in casual conversation. Our co-workers
					wasted no time stirring the pot, throwing playful teases my way: “Uy, ligawan mo na ’yan!” they
					said, nudging and winking.</p>
				<p>She laughed it off, flashing that beautiful smile, and said, “Ay naku, I’m not into younger guys.”
					Her words were direct and honest, like she always is, but I felt a little sting inside.
					Disappointed,
					I stayed quiet, too shy to respond, but deep inside, something had already begun to stir.</p>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/image7.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p><b>Teasing and Silent Glances</b></p>
				The teasing never stopped. Days turned to weeks, and every lunch or coffee break brought with it a new
				round of jokes and “matchmaking” from our ever-enthusiastic co-workers. I always stayed silent, laughing
				nervously, blushing behind my plate. I wasn’t the kind of guy who made bold moves. I was reserved,
				quiet, and unsure how to respond to this sudden attention.</p>
				<p>But she, she was different. She was talkative, friendly, and always full of life. She’d make the
					office feel warmer, lighter. She didn’t treat me like I was a kid. She treated me like someone worth
					talking to. Every moment shared—no matter how brief—began to mean more.
				</p>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/image16.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p><b>The Glass Wall (December 6, 2024)</b></p>
				Our workspaces were separated by a single transparent glass wall. One day, something new appeared taped
				to it, a small piece of paper with a message from the others. It started as a joke, a way to keep the
				teasing alive. Then more messages followed, playful and silly, like notes passed in a classroom.</p>
				<p>It all led to a dare: “Go to Sto. Niño Church together.”
					And surprisingly, she agreed.</p>
				<p>That simple, playful dare changed everything.</p>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/image15.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p><b>The Church and Jollibee</b></p>
				We went to Sto. Niño Church together. It felt surreal, peaceful, sacred, like the universe was giving us
				a quiet moment to realize what was growing between us. After the visit, we walked side by side through
				the streets of Cebu City, the lights of December beginning to glow.</p>
				<p>We ended up having dinner at Jollibee, just the two of us. I watched her talk, her eyes full of
					energy, her laugh contagious. Everything around me blurred. The store slowly emptied. Closing time
					came, but we just kept talking—about life, family, little things. I didn’t want the night to end.
					When I finally went home, I couldn’t stop smiling. My heart felt light, full, and happy.
				</p>

				<p><b>A Helping Hand and Heavy Groceries (December 24, 2024)</b></p>
				Christmas Eve came, and she invited me to help with groceries. I didn’t expect her to buy so much, but I
				didn’t complain. My arms nearly fell off, but her smile made it worth every aching muscle. My god, I had
				muscle pain for two days, but I'd carry those groceries again without hesitation.</p>
				<p>We delivered everything to her uncle’s house, where her whole family had gathered. It felt warm and
					joyful, like stepping into a home filled with love and tradition. I was a guest, but they made me
					feel welcome. And I realized something important: I didn’t just like her, I was falling for her.
				</p>


				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/image9.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p><b>Asking the Father</b></p>
				As the night ended, my heart raced. I knew I had to do something brave. I approached her father quietly
				and asked, “Pwede po ba manligaw sa anak niyo?”</p>
				<p>He looked at me, then simply said, “It’s okay.”
					My heart almost exploded with joy.
				</p>
				<p>She turned red, her face full of surprise, maybe even a little embarrassment, but her eyes shone
					differently that night. And in that moment, I knew: this was the beginning.</p>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/image12.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p><b>When It Begins</b></p>
				That was the moment everything changed. We started talking more. Chatting through the nights. Sharing
				thoughts, laughs, and little pieces of our daily lives. Every message brought us closer. Every day, we
				learned more about each other, our quirks, our dreams, our fears.</p>
				<p>Love didn’t come in a flash of fireworks or grand gestures. It grew slowly, sweetly, like a flower
					blooming in soft light. What started with teasing turned into genuine care. What began as a joke
					became something we both took seriously.</p>
				<p>And now, as time continues, we’re still growing, still learning, still loving, stronger with every
					trial, happier with every shared memory.</p>
				<p>Because when it begins with something real, it never really ends.</p>
